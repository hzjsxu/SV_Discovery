Structural variant discovery by combining multiple callers

This repository contains the scripts and codes used in the discovery of structural variants in the 3,000 rice genomes. 
They were not yet designed to be directly used by others without editing the codes. 
Future version will be released to allow others to just use the codes as single integrated pipeline without the need to
manually modify the codes.
